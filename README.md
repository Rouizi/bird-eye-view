# Birdâ€™s Eye View Perception

![](bird_eye_view.gif)

This repository contains my work on **Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) transformation** using both classical and deep learning methods.  
It includes inverse perspective mapping and deep learning-based multi-camera fusion by implementing **UNetXST** from the paper *"A Sim2Real Deep Learning Approach for the Transformation of Images from Multiple Vehicle-Mounted Cameras to a Semantically Segmented Image in Bird's Eye View."*

Please download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_6VdYSKZXZYgkMTVAfQuHL7l8UEWhUx6/view?usp=sharing).
